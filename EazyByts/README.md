## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm
- Java (JDK 17)
- MySQL

### Frontend Setup

1. Install the dependencies:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

2. Start the frontend development server:

    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Paarth-Chandan/ELearningBackend.git
    cd ELearningBackend
    ```

2. Set up MySQL database:

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE elearning_db;
    ```

3. Update `application.properties` file with your MySQL credentials:

    ```properties
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/elearning_db
    spring.datasource.username=YOUR_DB_USERNAME
    spring.datasource.password=YOUR_DB_PASSWORD
    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
    ```

4. Build and run the backend:

    ```sh
    cd backend
    mvn clean package
    java -jar target/ELearningBackend-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
    ```

The application should now be running with the frontend accessible at `http://localhost:3000` and the backend accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.
